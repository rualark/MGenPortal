# GUIDES
# 1. Getting started

## Step 1 - Sign up

Sign up to be able to upload files.

## Step 2 - Upload your music file

Currently supported upload format is MIDI. You will have to export MIDI file from your notation editor.

## Step 3 - Choose music type

You will always be able to perform your music with virtual instruments even if you do not choose music type. Choosing music type allows you to get access to additional options: analyse and correct counterpoint or cantus firmus and other algorithms. Also, if you choose counterpoint type, your music will be automatically split into track, which will allow you to perform it with different virtual instruments for each voice.

## Step 4 - Choose instruments

Usually we will detect number of instruments and instrument names in your MIDI file and try to map them to best available virtual instruments for performance. If no needed virtual instruments are available yet, please choose other instruments.

## Step 5 - Start processing jobs

After choosing options click on "Start jobs" button. Depending on music type selected, you will get MP3 of your performance or PDF with analysis.

## Step 6 - Tune config for better results

You can edit configurations for your jobs to fine tune our algorithms. For example, you can disable gliss articulation if you want. Please click job status to edit job config. See "Edit job config" article for more information.
